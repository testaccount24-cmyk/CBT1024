CSFXFER

CSFXFER is a REXX program which is used to move DES encryption
keys from one site to another. The original use case for this
program was a company that was divesting itself of part of its
business. The divested business set up a new computer system and
moved the data and programs into it. The original company
supplied data but would not pass anything over which was not part
of the divested business. When it came to encryption keys we
needed to agree a process to extract encryption keys from one
ICSF system and install them in another. CSFXFER provides a means
to handle this situation. It uses a common transport key which is
used to export operational keys from one ICSF keystore and them
import them into a subsequent keystore.
