RACFREE

RACFREE is an APF-authorised TSO command. It can be used to free
all the RACF dataset profiles associated with a TSO address
space. This means that any changes made to the profiles used by
the address space can be actioned without destroying the address
space and without affecting all other address spaces, as would be
needed if a SETROPTS command was used. The RACF command LISTDSD
can be used to perform this action for data set profiles. RACFREE
will work for all other classes of profile.

   FUNCTION : Free RACLISTed profiles and GENERIC profiles
              from address space ACEE

   Command Description:
      RACFREE  GENERIC/RACLIST/ALL
