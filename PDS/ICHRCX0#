ICHRCX02 for Erase On Scratch

This version of the RACF checking post-processing exit ICHRCX02
can be used to implement selective erasure of temporary data
sets.

On a standard RACF system the option to erase data sets when they
are scratched (or space is partially released) is available with
various controls. Data sets can be erased or not erased using
slective flags in each RACF generic profile. However, the only
way to ensure that temporary data sets are erased is to set your
system so that ALL data sets are erased on scratch. Many shops
are reluctant to use such a setting. More granularity is
required.

When dealing with applications which are to used encrypted data
sets, there are issues with temporary data set which are not
capable of encryption. This is especially relevant to the SORT
program which uses work areas that are not encrypted and that
SORT insists are temporary data sets.

One way to at least partially resolve this is to use this version
of the RACF ICHRCX02 exit to selectively request data set
erasure. I normally recommend this exit is used in conjunction
with the setting, SETROPTS CLASSACT(TEMPDSN)
