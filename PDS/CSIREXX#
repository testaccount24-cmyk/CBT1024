CSIREXX

CSIREXX can be used to extract information from the system
catalogs using the standard interface IGGCSI00. CSIREXX uses a
method similar to the RACF extract program IRRXUTIL. Each value
from a catalog is placed into a separate REXX variable.

CSIREXX can be used to search the catalog using the default
generic search/locate functions and can extract almost all
information needed for the redefinition of data sets or VSAM
clusters.

CSIREXX is a very powerful program that can be used to report on
data set and cluster details and can be used to build JCL and
IDCAMS statements to redefine data sets and clusters.
