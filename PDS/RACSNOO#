RACF Snoop

RACF Snoop is an ISPF application which enables the user to
examine the RACF environment for multiple address spaces. It is
possible see what RACF user ids are in use, current connect
group, various attributes and the programs being executed. RACF
Snoop requires two APF-authorised TSO commands to work. These
will need to be installed into a linklist library.

Included in this package is a manual for RACF Snoop and an older
document explaining details of how RACF generic profiles are
handled in storage and how to avoid some pitfalls.
