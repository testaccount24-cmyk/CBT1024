CONCAT

CONCAT is a TSO command. It is used to dynamically concatenate a
data set with an existing DDname. The new data set can be added
before or after the existing set. Duplicate data set names can be
added. It can also delete a data set from within an existing
concatenated set. If the data set to be added is not catalogued
then a volume and unit can be supplied. The search for the data
set can start from the top or bottom of the concatenated set.
CONCAT can also be used to test for the existence of a data set
within the concatenation. CONCAT runs without APF authorisation
and is very suitable for dynamically manipulating concatenated
data sets for use with ISPF.
