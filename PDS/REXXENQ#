REXXENQ0

REXXENQ0 can be used within a REXX routine to invoke another REXX
routine, but while the second routine is executing a systems wide
ENQ is held. This enables serialised access to a single object
which might normally be updated by multiple users across a
sysplex. Typically this resource would be a data set. Thus
corruptions to that data set due to concurrent updates can be
avoided. In addition, the REXX routine invoked can control the
nature of those updates.
