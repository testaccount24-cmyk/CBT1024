Programs and code

Over many years I have written hundreds of thousands of lines of
code. Most of this was for clients and employers, including IBM.
(I was part of the project that wrote the first z/OS
healthchecker, and also worked for a short while on zSecure
development.) I think a lot of code I wrote is still in use.

The following programs and code are examples of which may be of
use to you. All of these programs are supplied without absolute
guarantees ??. But they can be used entirely at your discretion.

CONCAT      TSO command for dynamic concatenation.
RACFREE     TSO command to free in-storage RACF resources.
TICKET      TSO command to tag RACF SMF records with change id.
ICHRCX02    for Erase On Scratch   Exit to selectively erase
            temporary data sets.
CSIREXX     REXX interface to read detailed catalog information.
CSFXFER     REXX routines to move a key from one CKDS to another CKDS.
REXXENQ0    Program to invoke a REXX routine while holding a global ENQ.
RACF Snoop  TSO commands and ISPF application to examine RACF
            security for multiple address spaces

Please contact me if,
  you find problems or bugs in the code,
  you need further information about them,
  you make any enhancements to the code or fix problems yourself.
  I would also appreciate the opportunity to incorporate your
  enhancements and/or fixes.

Before providing you access to the code, the links below ask you
to provide me a couple of contact details. Then I can contact you
if new versions or bug fixes become available or if I have new
programs available here.

If you wish, please use the 'Contact Me' page to comment on these
programs.

Final note: Many of these packages use files in XMIT format.
These files can be viewed on a Windows PC using various software
packages. I like the V file viewer. I have no connection with the
makers of this software except that I find the software really
useful and not expensive.
