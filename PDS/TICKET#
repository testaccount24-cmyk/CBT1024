TICKET

TICKET is used to associate a local change identifer with RACF
commands.

When RACF change requests are made they are frequently made via a
local change request system. Usually multiple commands are needed
to fulfil a single request. However, it is often difficult to
determine which RACF commands were used to fulfill a given
request. SMF records are written for each RACF command, yet they
have nothing within them to identify the change request. RACF
commands have no way to associate such a change identifier with
the command such that the SMF record for the command is tagged
with the identifer. Ticket provides a way to resolve this issue.

The TICKET command is supplied with a very small program called
TKTU834. This is to be installed at SMF exit point IEFU83 and
IEFU84. This can be installed dynamically if required. TKTU834 is
required for Ticket to work.

TICKET is an APF-authorised TSO command.
