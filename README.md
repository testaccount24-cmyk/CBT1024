//***FILE1024 is from Lennie Dymoke-Bradshaw, and contains some of  *   FILE1024
//*           the utilities he wrote for public distribution.       *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*      web site:  https://rsclweb.com/downloads/                  *   FILE1024
//*      name    :  Reverse Sweep Consulting Limited                *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     Distribution:                                               *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     Lennie normally distributes his code from his web site.     *   FILE1024
//*     So the remarks below are tailored for being distributed     *   FILE1024
//*     that way.  The reason for the method, is that Lennie        *   FILE1024
//*     wants to efficiently distribute updates (if any) to         *   FILE1024
//*     whomever needs them.  Therefore he asks each "downloader"   *   FILE1024
//*     to register personally.                                     *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     However, since I (Sam Golob) are registered with him also,  *   FILE1024
//*     Lennie can send me any updates, so that I can update the    *   FILE1024
//*     CBT Tape, and everybody who got it from here, will also     *   FILE1024
//*     get the updates in a timely manner.                         *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     Each program product (in this pds) will be distributed in   *   FILE1024
//*     two members:  PROGRAM and PROGRAM#.  This is the naming     *   FILE1024
//*     convention.  The PROGRAM member will contain a zip file     *   FILE1024
//*     containing all the source code and other "ingredients"      *   FILE1024
//*     necessary for installation and operation.  You should       *   FILE1024
//*     download the zip file for each program product to a PC,     *   FILE1024
//*     in BINARY, unzip it there, and you will have everything     *   FILE1024
//*     you need.                                                   *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     The PROGRAM# member contains a text (EBCDIC) description    *   FILE1024
//*     of the program package.                                     *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     If you get this material from here (the CBT Tape), you      *   FILE1024
//*     get all of the programs together, and you don't have to     *   FILE1024
//*     download them individually.                                 *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     Programs and Code                                           *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     Over many years I have written hundreds of thousands of     *   FILE1024
//*     lines of code. Most of this was for clients and             *   FILE1024
//*     employers, including IBM.  (I was part of the project       *   FILE1024
//*     that wrote the first z/OS healthchecker, and also worked    *   FILE1024
//*     for a short while on zSecure development.) I think a lot    *   FILE1024
//*     of code I wrote is still in use.                            *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     The following programs and code are examples of which       *   FILE1024
//*     may be of use to you. All of these programs are supplied    *   FILE1024
//*     without absolute guarantees ??. But they can be used        *   FILE1024
//*     entirely at your discretion.                                *   FILE1024

//*       I would also appreciate the opportunity to                *   FILE1024
//*       incorporate your enhancements and/or fixes.               *   FILE1024

//*     Before providing you access to the code, the links below    *   FILE1024
//*     ask you to provide me a couple of contact details. Then     *   FILE1024
//*     I can contact you if new versions or bug fixes become       *   FILE1024
//*     available or if I have new programs available here.         *   FILE1024
//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     If you wish, please use the 'Contact Me' page to comment    *   FILE1024

//*                                                                 *   FILE1024
//*     Final note: Many of these packages use files in XMIT        *   FILE1024
//*     format.  These files can be viewed on a Windows PC using    *   FILE1024
//*     various software packages. I like the V file viewer. I      *   FILE1024
//*     have no connection with the makers of this software         *   FILE1024
//*     except that I find the software really useful and not       *   FILE1024
//*     expensive.                                                  *   FILE1024
